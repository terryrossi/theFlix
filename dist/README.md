In this task, I have used build tools to build my theFlix app. In particular, I've set up my theFlix-client directory with the relevant files, and used Parcel to complete the necessary build operations for the project.

the project structure looks like this (in terms of source code):

theFlix
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── src
│ ├── index.html
│ ├── index.scss
│ └── index.jsx
